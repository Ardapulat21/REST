  This project is an ASP.NET Core application designed specifically to handle user authentication through JWT tokens. It receives user credentials, validates them against the database, and upon successful verification, generates and returns a secure JWT token. The main purpose of this application is to serve as an authentication provider for <b>PullAt</b> project, which manages the user interface and API controllers. By separating the authentication process into its own service, the system ensures better modularity, security, and scalability.
